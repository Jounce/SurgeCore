# SurgeCore

**SurgeCore** is an experimental blank-slate re-implementation of the lowest-level building blocks of the **Surge** project.

☣️ CAUTION: You absolutely do NOT want to depend on this project under ANY circumstances! ☢️

The idea is to split Surge up into smaller Swift Packages.

### Low-Level

- **SurgeCore**: Low-level functional core providing essential building blocks.

### High-Level

- **SurgeArithmetic**: High-level parallel computation APIs for arithmetic applications.
- **SurgeDSP**: High-level parallel computation APIs for digital signal processing applications (FFT, …).
- **SurgeLinearAlgebra**:  High-level parallel computation APIs for Scalar/Vector/Matrix applications.
- **SurgeStochastics**: High-level parallel computation APIs for stochastic applications (random numbers, sampling, …).
- **SurgeStatistics**: High-level parallel computation APIs for statistic applications (mean, variance, …).
- **SurgeTrigonometry**: High-level parallel computation APIs for trigonometry applications (sin, cos, atan, …).  
- **SurgeML**: High-level parallel computation APIs for Machine Learning applications (Sigmoid, …)
